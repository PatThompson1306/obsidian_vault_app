#### Summary
Ethnographic study of knowledge-based policing reforms in Norway reveals tensions between management-driven standardised knowledge and street-level officers' experience-based professionalism, with implementation creating resistance rather than transformation toward analytical, preventive policing practices.

#### Key Points
Knowledge-based policing promotes organizational professionalism (external control, performance metrics, standardised procedures) that threatens occupational professionalism (autonomy, discretion, collegial authority), leading officers to resist reforms through a "back-to-basics" strategy that reinforces traditional crime-fighting values over analytical approaches.
