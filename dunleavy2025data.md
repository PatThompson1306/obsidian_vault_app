#### Summary

This article introduces the "third wave" of Digital Era Governance (DEG 3) by analysing the transformative impact of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) on public administration. 

The authors identify four key macro-themes driving this new wave: the shift to **data decompression** in data-intensive information regimes, where the ability to analyse massive data stores removes the need for data-scarce Weberian bureaucracies ; the emergence of the **robotic state**, where automation expands the range of tasks machines can perform, consequently reshaping state organization ; the adoption of an **'intelligent centre, devolved delivery' (ICDD)** model for vertical policy sectors, partitioning state functions to maximize organizational productivity ; and the potential for **administrative holism** through horizontal integration, common capacity, and needs-based joining-up of services across government tiers. 

These themes collectively outline a long-term research agenda for public administration, suggesting profound administrative and organisational choices that must be made in the digital era.
