#### Summary
This commentary evaluates the practicality of four reflective learning frameworks (Kolb's, Gibbs', Schön's, and the "What" model) used in medical faculty training. It recommends integrating the simple "What" model into the Gibbs' reflective cycle or Kolb's framework to enhance learners' comprehension and application.

#### Key Points
Integration of the simple "What" model (`What? So what? Now what?`) with Gibbs' or Kolb's is recommended to make the reflective process more practical and comprehensible. Faculty workshop participants struggled with selecting models, application complexity, and ensuring depth of reflection in existing frameworks.
