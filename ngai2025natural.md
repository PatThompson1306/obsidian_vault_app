#### Summary

This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of NLP applications in government (2017-2023) and develops a conceptual framework mapping NLP techniques to government domains. It includes a case study of a Cantonese social media text analytics system implemented in a Hong Kong government department, demonstrating practical NLP deployment for public sector decision-making and citizen engagement.

#### Key Points

- **Framework Development**: Creates a two-layer conceptual framework aligning NLP applications with UN's Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) across 10 domains, supported by 6 key NLP technique classes
- **Literature Findings**: Analysed 103 articles from 36 journals; health sector dominates NLP adoption (50.5%); LDA most popular technique (19.6%); notable research gap in non-Western contexts
- **Societal Value Grid**: Introduces novel assessment framework evaluating NLP benefits across efficiency, effectiveness, and strategic dimensions with five competitive factors (time, interaction, relationship, people, service)
- **Case Study Results**: Cantonese text analytics system achieved 73.2% precision, 77.5% recall, 75.3% F1-score in sentiment classification; 83.1% precision in entity segmentation
- **Implementation Challenges**: Identified critical barriers including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, transparency issues, Cantonese dictionary development, and need for continuous model adaptation
