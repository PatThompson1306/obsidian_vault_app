#### Summary
The paper explains how tacit (“know-how”) and explicit (“know-what”) knowledge function in organizations and how balancing them improves learning, innovation, and performance. It highlights methods for creating, sharing, and leveraging both types of knowledge to strengthen competitive advantage.
#### Key Points
Tacit knowledge is personal, experiential, and shared through social interaction, while explicit knowledge is codified, formal, and stored in systems. Effective organizations create supportive cultures, reward knowledge sharing, and integrate technology with human processes to harness both forms.
