#### Summary
Addressed the empirical gap in non-English speaking countries by analysing criminological characteristics from 257 Online Child Sexual Grooming (OCSG) cases in Spanish police reports to differentiate contact-driven from online-focused suspects. 

#### Key Points
Findings suggested that contact-driven suspects were more likely to use positive rapport and send un-prompted sexually explicit images, and their victims were significantly more likely to be male and offer exchanges for sex/images.
