#### Summary
Expert interviews with 20 London-based crime prevention practitioners reveal obstacles to deploying surveillance-oriented security technologies (SOSTs), identifying key challenges including system interoperability issues, lack of institutional support and clear guidelines, resource constraints, and tensions between operational needs and social acceptability concerns, with practitioners more focused on functionality than ethical considerations.

#### Key Points
Practitioners demonstrated openness to technological innovation but faced severe implementation barriers: incompatibility between new and legacy systems caused workflow disruptions, deployment decisions excluded front-line input resulting in unintended consequences, and lack of political/financial commitment combined with unclear regulations created frustration; findings reveal disconnect between academic focus on privacy/ethics debates and practitioners' emphasis on operational efficiency, effectiveness, and system compatibility as primary concerns.
