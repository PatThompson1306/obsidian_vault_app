#### Summary
Literature review and empirical study examining reflection in preservice teacher education, proposing four types of writing (descriptive writing, descriptive reflection, dialogic reflection, critical reflection) based on analysis of student teachers' written reports, with findings showing predominantly descriptive reflection and minimal critical reflection.

#### Key Points
Collaborative "critical friend" dyads and verbal interaction with trusted others proved most effective strategies for fostering reflection, though students struggled to move beyond descriptive and dialogic forms to critical reflection that addresses broader socio-political contexts; developmental approach needed that progresses from technical skills through various reflection-on-action types toward eventual reflection-in-action capacity.
