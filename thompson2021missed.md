#### Summary
A study of serious crime investigations in the South of England found significant police failure in utilizing digital evidence, missing all digital opportunities in 50% of enquiries. This deficiency, caused by investigator knowledge gaps and technical complexity, threatens public confidence and police legitimacy.

#### Key Points
The research established a critical capability lag: 50% of serious crime investigations missed all digital opportunities, and 47% missed subsequent ones after an initial digital line of enquiry was identified. The core challenge lies in the police's knowledge gap and the difficulty of applying the evolving pace of modern digital tactics within a historically rooted criminal justice system.
