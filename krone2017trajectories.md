#### Summary
Exploratory study examining 152 Australian offenders convicted of online child sexual exploitation offences (primarily child exploitation material possession) to determine relationships between online and contact offending, finding that while most committed only online offences, networking roles (providing/producing images, network participation) were significantly associated with contact offending trajectories.

#### Key Points
Study found 13.8% had prior sexual offence convictions and 6.6% recidivism rate for sexual offences; significant relationship emerged between contact offending and CEM network involvement (passive participation, providing images, producing images), suggesting networking may play role in escalating from non-production CEM offences to production and contact offending, though no clear linear transition from online to offline offending observed.
