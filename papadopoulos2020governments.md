#### Summary
This paper utilises Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including topic modelling and document clustering, to analyse the raw text of twelve national Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies, aiming to understand key governmental plans and priorities for AI adoption. 

The overall analysis highlights a shared focus across countries on the data ecosystem's importance, growing consideration of ethical and safety issues, and a global ambition to lead the AI race. 

The clustering of strategies revealed two principal groupings: one, including China and Japan, promotes purely technology and innovation-driven development to integrate AI with the economy; and a second, including the Scandinavian, German, and Luxemburgish strategies, which places a higher priority on the public sector's role as both an investor/promoter and a user/beneficiary of AI, coupled with a stronger emphasis on ethical and safety considerations.
