#### Summary
Semi-structured interviews with 26 UK police officers identify six primary contemporary policing challenges: public trust erosion, recruitment/retention difficulties, resource constraints, inadequate training (especially digital skills), undefined police role, and preventing complex crimes (fraud/cybercrime), with officers proposing solutions centred on accountability, professionalisation, and community engagement.

#### Key Points
Officers attribute trust erosion to misconduct, negative publicity, and inadequate skills, proposing solutions including ethical leadership, cultural change, transparency, and integrity enhancement; recruitment challenges stem from low pay, heavy workloads, and eroded trust, risking compromised vetting and experience drain that further undermines service quality and public confidence in a self-reinforcing cycle of decline.
