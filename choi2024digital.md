#### Summary
Aimed to understand the sentencing landscape in the US for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) cases by analysing the influence of offender characteristics, prior convictions, and law enforcement involvement on sentencing severity. 

#### Key Points
The study found that prior conviction history and the victim's age were related to sentence length, but importantly, neither the offender’s age/gender nor law enforcement jurisdiction significantly impacted sentencing severity, suggesting judicial impartiality.
